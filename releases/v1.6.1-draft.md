# v1.6.1 - Draft Release Notes (2025-10-15)

Summary

This release introduces a focused refactor around OBS integration, adds guardrails for automatic recording, and cleans up versioning baseline.

Highlights

- New: `adapters/obsBridge.js` — central OBS WebSocket bridge with reconnect/backoff and events.
- Guardrails: disk-space warning (GetStats), duplicate-start protection (GetRecordStatus), scene sanity (SetCurrentProgramScene with fallback), and confirmation timeout + retry toast.
- UX: rec chip and connection chip wired to bridge events for reliable status.
- Docs: `docs/forge_obs_flow.md` added with Camera→OBS→Anvil→Output flow and recommended OBS settings.
- Version: bumped to `1.6.1`; baseline set to `mainframe`.
