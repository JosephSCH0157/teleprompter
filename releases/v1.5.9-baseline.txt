Teleprompter Pro v1.5.9 â€” Baseline (2025-10-06)

Includes:
- Centralized ScrollManager (core/scroll-manager.js) with PD loop, deadband, single-flight rAF
- Viewer-first scroller selection; early lock; fallback from HTML/body when not-scrollable
- Teleprompter/catchup unblocked: bounded-advance within deadband; compatible write-locks
- Motion quality: adaptive taper near target; quiet low-velocity writes; sub-pixel suppression; sticky settle
- Diagnostics: throttled anim rejections; polite HUD autoscroll; rAF-based HUD reads; one-time extension error logger
- Packaging: HTML loads core before main; legacy inline ScrollManager removed from teleprompter_pro.js

Status: Known issues remain (edge-case stalls near target under specific content). Declaring this as a working baseline to unblock next steps.

Source of truth: teleprompter_pro.js (header indicates version) and MANIFEST.md
