# v1.7.3 — TypeScript migration for recording/adapter core

## Highlights

- Converted to TypeScript: `recorders.ts`, `adapters/bridge.ts`, and `adapters/obs.ts`.
- Runtime compatibility preserved: Added a `build:compat` step that compiles these `.ts` files to in-place `.js` so existing imports and the HTML boot path remain unchanged.
- Stability validated: Strict smoke passed (`ok:true`) after the migration; recorder and adapter readiness confirmed.

## Changes

Migrate JS → TS for:

- `recorders.ts` (compiled to `recorders.js`)
- `adapters/bridge.ts` (compiled to `adapters/bridge.js`)
- `adapters/obs.ts` (compiled to `adapters/obs.js`)

Build: New `build:compat` script emits the runtime `.js` from TypeScript sources; wired into smoke tasks.

## Why this matters

- Establishes a typed foundation for future refactors without breaking the current boot/import surface.
- Keeps local and CI workflows stable: no import path changes, no HTML edits required.

## Upgrade notes

- No breaking changes expected.
- If you build locally, run:

```powershell
npm ci
npm run build:ts
npm run build:compat
npm run smoke:strict
```

- Editors/linters will now surface types for these modules; consider adding them to your tsconfig include for full typechecking in CI if not already.

## Known considerations

- OBS integrations remain functionally identical to prior behavior; this release focuses on TS migration, not new OBS features.
- If you previously committed built `.js` for these modules, ensure your workflow doesn’t re-overwrite the compiled outputs unintentionally.
