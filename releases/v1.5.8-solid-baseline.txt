Teleprompter Pro v1.5.8 â€” Solid baseline (2025-10-04)

Includes:
- Virtual lines (merged short runts) with duplicate gating against merged keys
- Coverage-based "soft advance" to prevent stalls once a line is consumed
- Junk-anchor gate v2 to block medium jumps driven only by junk tokens
- Line-cluster disambiguation (prefix signature penalty) to avoid bouncing
- End-game easing (+0.03 sim near last ~30 tokens) and bottom guard helper
- Better "lost/stall" instrumentation with one-line STALL summaries
- Normalized line keys and HUD spoken tail; updated HUD diagnostics
