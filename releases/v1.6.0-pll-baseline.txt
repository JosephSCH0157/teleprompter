# Teleprompter Pro v1.6.0 - PLL Controller Baseline

## Major Features
- PLL Controller: Phase-Locked Loop bias controller for hybrid auto-scroll
- PID-like feedback (Kp=0.022, Kd=0.0025) with state machine (LOCK_SEEK/LOCKED/COAST/LOST)
- End-game taper, anchor rate-limiting, forward-only bias at low confidence
- Pause breathing: faster decay during speech pauses for natural feel
- Live readout (Lead/Lag, Bias, State) and telemetry counters

## Guardrails
- End-game taper: softens bias in last 20% of script
- Anchor rate-limit: 1200ms cooldown prevents anchor spam
- Forward-only bias: no accidental slow-downs at low confidence
- Pause breathing: responds to onspeechend/onaudioend events

## Production Defaults
- hybridLock: OFF (power-user toggle)
- Kp: 0.022, Kd: 0.0025, maxBias: 0.12
- confMin: 0.60, decayMs: 550

## Files Modified
- teleprompter_pro.js: PLL controller implementation
- debug-tools.js: PLL logging and speech event handling
- teleprompter_pro.html: PLL settings UI
- VERSION.txt, CHANGELOG.md, MANIFEST.md, README.md: version updates

## Testing Checklist
- Enable hybrid lock in Settings → Advanced
- Start speech recognition and auto-scroll
- Verify smooth speed adjustments based on position
- Check debug HUD (~) for PLL logs
- Test pause breathing: speak → pause → bias decays faster
- Test end-game: near script end, bias is reduced
- Test anchor rate-limit: rapid anchor attempts are throttled
