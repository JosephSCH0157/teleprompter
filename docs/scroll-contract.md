# Scroll Contract (SSOT Runtime Boundaries)

This document is the executable contract for scroll behavior.
`MANIFEST.md` owns architecture mapping; this file owns runtime boundaries.

## 1) SSOT Keys

- `scrollMode: EngineScrollMode` (owner: `appStore`)
- `scrollEnabled: boolean` (owner: `appStore`)
- `session.asrEngaged: boolean` (owner: `src/state/session.ts`)
- `session.asrArmed: boolean` (owner: `src/state/session.ts`)

`auto`/`off` are dialect states and must map through `scrollMode + scrollEnabled`.

## 2) ASR Invariants (Hard)

When `scrollMode='asr'`:

- No timed/hybrid/wpm motor may run.
- No auto-intent flow may drive scroll.
- No preroll event may trigger movement.
- Movement trigger is ASR commit only.
- Commit path is writer-first: `seekToBlockAnimated(...)`.
- Pixel `driveToLine` is fallback only when writer/block mapping is unavailable.

## 3) Allowed Flows by Mode

- `timed`: timed engine drives movement when `scrollEnabled=true`.
- `wpm`: wpm adapter/timed drive movement when `scrollEnabled=true`.
- `hybrid`: motor + ASR correction lane (no ASR-only commit assertions).
- `asr`: commit-driven seek only; no motor lane.
- `step`: discrete manual stepping only.
- `rehearsal`: no programmatic movement; clamp behavior only.

## 4) Hydrate Contract

- Profile hydrate must not silently force runtime mode to ASR unless ASR is already engaged or user selected ASR in current session.
- Hydrate writes affecting scroll mode must be attributable (`withScrollModeWriter` metadata with source tags).

## 5) Kick Contract

- Kick is manual movement and never depends on motor/auto-intent.
- Kick resolves scroller by viewer role (`main` vs `display`) before movement.
- Kick prefers writer path; pixel nudge is fallback.
- Hotkeys and buttons call typed kick entrypoints only.
- Dev globals are allowed only in dev mode and must not leak to production.

## 6) Forbidden Flows

- Motor tick writes while `scrollMode='asr'`.
- Auto-intent writes while `scrollMode='asr'`.
- Unattributed hydrate mode writes.
- Publishing scroll globals outside `src/index-app.ts`.
- Defining new local ScrollMode unions instead of importing canonical types.
